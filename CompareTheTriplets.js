/*
Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.
The rating for Alice's challenge is the triplet a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]),
and the rating for Bob's challenge is the triplet b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).

The task is to calculate their comparison points by comparing each category:

If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.
Example

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [3, 2, 1]

For elements *0*, Bob is awarded a point because a[0] < b[0].
For the equal elements a[1] and b[1], no points are earned.
Finally, for elements 2, a[2] > b[2] so Alice receives a point.
The return array is [1, 1] with Alice's score first and Bob's second.

Function Description

Complete the function compareTriplets with the following parameter(s):
int a[3]: Alice's challenge rating
int b[3]: Bob's challenge rating

Returns
int[2]: the first element is Alice's score and the second is Bob's score
